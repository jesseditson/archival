## What is archival?

archival is a library for building database-free content-oriented websites.

Learn more at [archival.dev](https://archival.dev).

## Examples

Lots of websites are built on archival, including https://archival.dev and https://editor.archival.dev - the former being the official documentation and the latter a WASM-based rust application that runs via a service worker. You can see the code for each here:

- https://github.com/jesseditson/archival-docs
- https://github.com/jesseditson/archival-editor

Another example of a super simple website is a blog:

https://github.com/jesseditson/jesseditson.com

Most websites built on archival start with a template - all of our templates can be browsed here:

https://editor.archival.dev/new

They can all be previewed directly in your browser, and when you're ready you can set up your own site with one click.
